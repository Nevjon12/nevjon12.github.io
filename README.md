Thank you so much for visiting.

I'm currently working on showcasing my skills by building a number of applications to solve day to day problems. If you find any of these useful, please feel free to bookmark them. If you do, it'd be awesome if you went to https://github.com/Nevjon12/nevjon12.github.io and starred the project. 

As of now you will find the following:

# Job Application Tracker:

With this straightforward app you'll be able to keep track and take notes of the status of all your job applications. I ended up putting it together because i got kind of tired of spreadsheets hehe.

  How Fix?

  - Input the title and the position. THATS IT. Date applied is automatically filled in
  - Click on an application card and then just type away, notes save as you type.
  - Be organized. Stay moisturized. Keep GirlBossing.


# Savings Planner (IN PROGRESS)

Have you ever gotten tired of having to figure out all the math needed to see how much you'd need to save up in time for that big vacation? Or have you ever just needed figure out how much you need to save just to stay afloat? I know I have.

  How Fix?

  - Set your current balance, income and expenses.
  - Set the frequencies at which these amounts change (Nothing hits quite like Pay Day)
  - Set a minimum threshold that your account must be at for you to feel safe and comfy
  - Set a goal, dont be shy, aim for the sky!
  - Set a time range so you can see what it would look like if you stuck to your plan for a month. Or months. Maybe a year? A decade? Bet.
  - Watch as a graph shows you the state of your account using your current plan, aint it grand?
  - Be organized. Stay moisturized. Keep GirlBossing.
